## overview:
Analyzing student data with python, utilizing conda and panda

## findings:
In general, Python and Pandas are effective tools to analyze large data sheets. In Pandas, .loc appears more intuitive and readable than .iloc in this kind of analysis due to searching via names rather than indices. Specific to this analysis, charter schools are capable of producing higher average math grades than public schools despite having lower average budgets. Additional worthwhile analysis on this topic could include finding budget per student amounts and looking to see if similar trends exist for reading scores.
